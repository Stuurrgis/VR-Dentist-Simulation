# VR-Dentist-Simulation
Virtual/mixed reality environment that helps desensitize children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) before their dental appointments. Built in the Unity engine with the C# language and utilizing the Acer mixed reality headset.

(Note: This isn't the full Unity project, as I wanted to make this repository clean, but I've added code samples for various functions and actions)
